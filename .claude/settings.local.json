Changed from removing only 1 leading zero to using TrimStart(''0'') to remove all leading zeros.\n\nThis was preventing GT06 devices from associating with their Assets when IMEI had format like 0000018404228323.\n\nChanges:\n- ConcoxMessageHandler.GetImei(): Replace single character removal with TrimStart(''0'')\n\n🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>\nEOF\n)\")"
